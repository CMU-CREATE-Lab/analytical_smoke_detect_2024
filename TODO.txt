Version 0.3
Be able to see opacity
  Maybe use textured background, or bright green?
  Maybe show opacity map (alpha channel) with colors and/or contours?
  Maybe also show color of smoke with alpha=1?
What subsampling is happening?  Is it nearest neighbor (ugh) or actually low-pass filtering in some way?
Parallelize v2 patchwise
See how parallelized v2 scales to larger images

BACKLOG:
Try time-series / video.  Can we do patches for video?
    What size patch seems good?
        8x8x8 = 512 pixels
Decode video into numpy array 
How to show time-series smoke?


DONE Version 0.2
DONE Display CPU time for v2 (single)
DONE Reduce logging for v2 (patches)
DONE Use sparse least squares to detect haze locally (i.e. in patches)
DONE Combine patches to get a global haze map
DONE Commit

DONE Version 0.1
DONE Uses sparse least squares to detect haze in an entire image at once
